    "### Project summary\n",
    "\n",
    "I theorized that the biggest reason this happened is cause of \"old-money\". This means that people that have accumulated wealth over the years can pass it over to their children and make heavy investments in their future, subsidizing in the process the future opportunities of those that are not this fortunate. If you look around you (in your university circles or the internet), you can notice that those that are educated in the greatest universities come from families with established wealth. This is mostly due to the fact that colleges have adopted business model and prefer money over bright students (or prefer money more than a poor bright kid, I am not implying that wealthy kids are not smart). This increases the opportunities of wealthy families keeping their wealth in the future while decreasing the opportunities of poorer families to get richer and \"make it\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, I created a model based on real world data that simulates a N people population each having a set of characteristics and then i did what computers do best and simulated this population through time to see if inequality will change if we let people inherit the money of their parents. Inheritance has a lot more to do with the money one's parents have while they are alive and lot less while they are dead but in this way we can still get notable results while still staying true to the reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Footnote\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of both the model and the simulation follow in the lines of code below. I have to be clear that this project was made for fun and for me to try to test my Python, statistics and R skills while finding out something I was really curious about. For this reason, I INSIST that you do take what is described with a big grain of salt as it is only a model of society and does not try to replicate every single aspect of reality. In the future I hope I improve on both the model and the simulation, adding more features and making it as close to reality as I can.\n"
