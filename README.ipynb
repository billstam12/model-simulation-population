    "# In what level does inheritance affect the capital distribution of a population?\n",
    "## Find out with the help of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief Historical Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is the state in which an individual passes his or her possessions into his or her offspring. Inheritance can be rather controversial in a capitalist state, as it encourages accumulation of wealth, and that's because the individual knows that everything he worked for in his life will be passed onto his child. For this, many countries have passed tax laws that make the thought of inheriting or passing wealth rather unwanted.[]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inequality through the ages\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take into account that capitalism is a political ideology that wants people to work and make their own fortunes, having a fossil from the centuries past to govern our wealth distribution is something quite unfitting. What should better stimulate someone to make money in the long run is an ideology of mutual assistance between the state and the people. A state in which people know that they can compete based on their skills as an individual and not based on their parents' status and wealth. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our day and age in which multiculturalism is prelevant, the effects of the accumulation of wealth in families is quite visible from the cradle to the grave. Fortunate children of people with considerable ammounts of wealth can live the lives of their choice by studying in whichever college they want(or even not studying at all) and by working in companies and institutions that provide huge salaries and accomodations.[] In the other hand, those unlucky enough to be born into poverty or a working class environment in which working to provide for their families is the only option they will ever have, aren't destinged for this bright futures or opportunities. Surely, one will say that a situation like the one I am describing above existed for millenia, and the answer to that is a big fat YES, but the underlying problem is one far superior to just saying that \"meh, inheritance is flawed\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the old days of kings and kingdoms, inequality in our age is a non-existent concept. Back then, the only ones that had any amounts of wealth and/or power/influence where those of nobility and the people that did business with them. By the end of the 18th century, the situation changed drastically and that's really thanks to capitalism. Of course we know that for ages inequality and exploitation in capitalist states has been prevelant and most likely will be till the end of time. Knowing that though we can also aknowledge that through the ages workers have sharpened their skills and have demanded better treatment through rallies and political fights. And these struggles have not been in vein especially after the second world war, as inequality in the 50s and 60s was in an all time low. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Inequality today\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then and with the prevelance of globalization in the 80s and 90s a lot of things have changed and what was accomplished in the capitalist societies of the middle 20th century is steadily going down the drain. Student debts, unemployment and employment uncertainty defines the working society of today and especially the youth. While older generations achieved the \"American dream\" and managed to buy a house and multiple cars, have a career and make a family (whom they were able to educate in the greatest colleges), millenials can't even dream of doing anything of the above -as many studies have shown[]. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Project summary\n",
    "\n",
    "I theorized that the biggest reason this happened is cause of \"old-money\". This means that people that have accumulated wealth over the years can pass it over to their children and make heavy investments in their future, subsidizing in the process the future opportunities of those that are not this fortunate. If you look around you (in your university circles or the internet), you can notice that those that are educated in the greatest universities come from families with established wealth. This is mostly due to the fact that colleges have adopted business model and prefer money over bright students (or prefer money more than a poor bright kid, I am not implying that wealthy kids are not smart). This increases the opportunities of wealthy families keeping their wealth in the future while decreasing the opportunities of poorer families to get richer and \"make it\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, I created a model based on real world data that simulates a N people population each having a set of characteristics and then i did what computers do best and simulated this population through time to see if inequality will change if we let people inherit the money of their parents. Inheritance has a lot more to do with the money one's parents have while they are alive and lot less while they are dead but in this way we can still get notable results while still staying true to the reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Footnote\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of both the model and the simulation follow in the lines of code below. I have to be clear that this project was made for fun and for me to try to test my Python, statistics and R skills while finding out something I was really curious about. For this reason, I INSIST that you do take what is described with a big grain of salt as it is only a model of society and does not try to replicate every single aspect of reality. In the future I hope I improve on both the model and the simulation, adding more features and making it as realer as I can.\n"
