### Brief Historical Overview 

#### What is inheritance?

Inheritance is the state in which an individual passes his or her possessions into his or her offspring. Inheritance can be rather controversial in a capitalist state, as it encourages accumulation of wealth, and that's because the individual knows that everything he worked for in his life will be passed onto his child. For this, many countries have passed tax laws that make the thought of inheriting or passing wealth rather unwanted.[]

### Inequality through the ages

If we take into account that capitalism is a political ideology that wants people to work and make their own fortunes, having a fossil from the centuries past to govern our wealth distribution is something quite unfitting. What should better stimulate someone to make money in the long run is an ideology of mutual assistance between the state and the people. A state in which people know that they can compete based on their skills as an individual and not based on their parents' status and wealth. 

In our day and age in which multiculturalism is prelevant, the effects of the accumulation of wealth in families is quite visible from the cradle to the grave. Fortunate children of people with considerable ammounts of wealth can live the lives of their choice by studying in whichever college they want(or even not studying at all) and by working in companies and institutions that provide huge salaries and accomodations.[] In the other hand, those unlucky enough to be born into poverty or a working class environment in which working to provide for their families is the only option they will ever have, aren't destinged for this bright futures or opportunities. Surely, one will say that a situation like the one I am describing above existed for millenia, and the answer to that is a big fat YES, but the underlying problem is one far superior to just saying that "meh, inheritance is flawed". 

Compared to the old days of kings and kingdoms, inequality in our age is a non-existent concept. Back then, the only ones that had any amounts of wealth and/or power/influence where those of nobility and the people that did business with them. By the end of the 18th century, the situation changed drastically and that's really thanks to capitalism. Of course we know that for ages inequality and exploitation in capitalist states has been prevelant and most likely will be till the end of time. Knowing that though we can also aknowledge that through the ages workers have sharpened their skills and have demanded better treatment through rallies and political fights. And these struggles have not been in vein especially after the second world war, as inequality in the 50s and 60s was in an all time low. 

### Inequality today

Since then and with the prevelance of globalization in the 80s and 90s a lot of things have changed and what was accomplished in the capitalist societies of the middle 20th century is steadily going down the drain. Student debts, unemployment and employment uncertainty defines the working society of today and especially the youth. While older generations achieved the "American dream" and managed to buy a house and multiple cars, have a career and make a family (whom they were able to educate in the greatest colleges), millenials can't even dream of doing anything of the above -as many studies have shown[].
